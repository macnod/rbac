has fields that reference TABLE-1 and TABLE-2, creating a new link between
rows in TABLE-1 and TABLE-2.

Parameters:
  - TABLE-1 (string): The name of the first table.
  - TABLE-2 (string): The name of the second table.

Description:

This function makes the following assumptions:

  - The names of TABLE-1 and TABLE-2 can be plural and plurals always end in
    's'.

  - The link table already exists and has a name consists of the singular of
    TABLE-1, followed by an underscore, followed by TABLE-2 (plural or not).

  - In the link table, the field, xref1, that references TABLE-1 has a name that
    consists of the singular of TABLE-1 followed by '_id'. The same is true for
    the field, xref2, that references TABLE-2.

  - The link table has a unique index on the pair of rows that reference
    TABLE-1 and TABLE-2, unique({xref1}_id, {xref2}_id).

  - All the tables have a primary key named 'id' of type UUID, and, in addition
    to the already mentioned foreign key references, the link table has the
    fields 'updated_by' (timestamp), 'updated_at' (uuid), and 'deleted_at'
    (uuid).

For example, if you call the function with 'roles' and 'permissions', the
function will make the following concrete assumptions:

  - The name of the link table, where a row will be upserted, is
    'role_permissions'.

  - The link table will contain the following fields:

    - role_id (uuid, references 'roles')

    - permission_id (uuid, references 'permissions')

    - updated_by (uuid, references 'users')

    - updated_at (timestamp)

    - deleted_at (timestamp)

  - The link table will contain a unique index on (role_id, permission_id)
